# App Description

This Flutter app consists of a password-protected screen as the first page and a YouTube video player on the second page. The app is designed for smooth navigation between the two pages while maintaining security and functionality.


## Password-Protected Screen:

Users must enter the correct password (e.g., "12345") to proceed.
An incorrect password triggers an error message via a SnackBar

## YouTube Video Page:

Upon successful authentication, users are directed to a page featuring an embedded YouTube video.
The video is initially masked with a semi-transparent overlay for user interaction.
A button allows users to "Unlock Video" and view/play the YouTube content seamlessly.

## Key Features:

Password-based access control.
Embedded YouTube video player with progress tracking.
Interactive masking for an enhanced user experience.
Intuitive navigation using Navigator.push and Navigator.pop.


This app demonstrates a mix of basic security and multimedia integration, making it ideal for tutorials, video courses, or content-based applications.
